## ðŸ›‘ Problem Statement
Financial fraud costs institutions billions annually. Traditional rule-based systems:
- Fail to detect **new fraud patterns**  
- Generate **high false positives**  
- Lack **real-time adaptability**  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Solution
SentinelAI uses **data-driven intelligence** to:
- Continuously learn fraud patterns  
- Adapt to changing attack strategies  
- Minimize false positives using advanced statistical and ML techniques  
- Provide **Explainable AI** reports for compliance

## ðŸ”„ Process Flow
1. **Data Ingestion** â†’ Real-time transaction streams (Kafka / API feeds)  
2. **Preprocessing** â†’ Cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering  
3. **Model Inference** â†’ Anomaly detection + supervised classification models  
4. **Alert Generation** â†’ Fraud probability score + flagged transaction ID  
5. **Explainability Layer** â†’ SHAP/LIME-based feature impact analysis  
6. **API Integration** â†’ REST APIs for seamless integration into enterprise systems
